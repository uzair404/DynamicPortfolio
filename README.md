# DynamicPortfolio

first of all, i am sorry because there are conflicts in migration because i was lazy to add migration through command line so i just directly added table in database.It was a very bad desicion and i regret it.
I will add mysql file for this project in root directory so please download it.

this version of My Portfolio is also live on [Click me to go to test.createmyprotfolio.com](https://www.test.createmyprotfolio.com) and you can do changes in this website.
